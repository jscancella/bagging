## Documentation
We strive to have great documentation! Thus this file follows recommendations from https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/
Editors and grammar aficionados are welcome and encouraged to edit this content to make it even better! See `Helping Contribute` below.

### Explanation
#### What is a "bag"?
A "bag" is a way to transfer files from one location to another and verify that the files sent are complete (you received exactly what you were supposed to receive), and that they are correct (none of the bits have changed). While many people use "bags" for other purposes, they are tangential to the purpose of file transfer. 

#### What is a typical use case for a bag?
Typically you need to send files out of band (i.e. not using the internet) and you need to ensure that all the files are received correctly. Usually this is due to the amount of files being transferred is very large, the internet connection is too slow or unreliable, or there is no physical connection to the internet.

#### What is fetching?
To save on transferring all the files (or multiple copies of the same file) you can use a fetch.txt file. This special file lists where those other files are located on the internet. This library does not handle trying to retrieve these files due to the complicated nature of retrieving files over the internet.

#### What is a BagIt-Profile?
A BagIt-Profile is a [specification](http://www.bagit-profiles.github.io/bagit-profile-specification) that allows creators and consumers agree on what should be included in a bag. These agreements are saved in a bagit-profile file formatted in JSON and available from a URI (see the specification for more details/requirements). See the `How to verify against a profile?` section for more information

#### How do I include information about the bag within the bag? (metadata)
There is a special file called bag-info.txt (or package-info.txt for older versions) that is formatted for easy reading by humans. This file is just a list of key value pairs, and with some very few exceptions has no bearing on the bag other than to give additional information.

#### History of bagit
The BagIt specification was first created by the Library of Congress because it needed a way to verify that donated material on hard drives was correct and complete.

### How-to guides
#### How to read a bag?
```java
Path rootDir = Paths.get("RootDirectoryOfExistingBag");
Bag bag = Bag.read(rootDir);
```

#### How to write a bag?
```java
Path outputDir = Paths.get("WhereYouWantToWriteTheBagTo");
bag.write(outputDir); //where bag is a Bag object
```

#### How to create a bag programmatically?
```java
BagBuilder builder = new BagBuilder();
Bag bag = builder.addAlgorithm("md5")
    .addPayloadFile(Paths.get("/foo.txt"))
    .addMetadata("someKey", "someValue")
    .rootDir(Paths.get("/myNewBag"))
    .write();
```

#### How to validate a bag?
There are three kinds of validations:
1. Verify a bag is complete.
2. Verify a bag is correct.
3. Just check file count and bite size.

##### Verify Complete
```java
boolean ignoreHiddenFiles = true;
bag.isValid(ignoreHiddenFiles);
```

##### Verify Valid (both complete and correct)
```java
boolean ignoreHiddenFiles = true;
bag.isComplete(ignoreHiddenFiles);
```

#### How to lint a bag (check for potential issues)?
```java
Path folder = Paths.get("BagYouWantToCheck");
Set<BagitWarning> warnings = BagLinter.lintBag(folder);
```

#### How to verify against a profile?
```java
Path rootDir = Paths.get("RootDirectoryOfExistingBag");
Bag bag = Bag.read(rootDir);
InputStream jsonProfile = new URL("https://github.com/bagit-profiles/bagit-profiles/blob/1.1.0/bagProfileFoo.json").openStream();
assert BagLinter.checkAgainstProfile(jsonProfile, bag) == true;
```

#### How to include a new checksum algorithm?
By default MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 are provided. However, there will be times when you want (or must) use a different algorithm. 

The [BagitChecksumNameMapping](https://github.com/jscancella/bagging/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/jscancella/hash/BagitChecksumNameMapping.java) 
contains the mapping between bagit checksum names and their implementation and is the only place you need to modify to change which implementation you would like to use.
Note: to enable multi-threaded bag creation and checking multiple instances of the hasher could exist at the same time.

```java
public enum SHA3Hasher implements Hasher {
  
  private static final int _64_KB = 1024 * 64;
  private static final int CHUNK_SIZE = _64_KB;
  private static final String MESSAGE_DIGEST_NAME = "SHA3-256";
  private MessageDigest messageDigestInstance;

  @Override
  public String hash(Path path) throws IOException{
    reset();
    updateMessageDigest(path, messageDigestInstance);
    return formatMessageDigest(messageDigestInstance);
  }

  @Override
  public void update(byte[] bytes, int length){
    messageDigestInstance.update(bytes, 0, length);
  }

  @Override
  public String getHash(){
    return formatMessageDigest(messageDigestInstance);
  }

  @Override
  public void reset(){
    messageDigestInstance.reset();
  }

  @Override
  public String getBagitAlgorithmName(){
    return "sha3256";
  }
  
  private static void updateMessageDigest(final Path path, final MessageDigest messageDigest) throws IOException{
    try(final InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream(Files.newInputStream(path, StandardOpenOption.READ))){
      final byte[] buffer = new byte[CHUNK_SIZE];
      int read = is.read(buffer);

      while(read != -1){
        messageDigest.update(buffer, 0, read);
        read = is.read(buffer);
      }
    }
  }
  
  private static String formatMessageDigest(final MessageDigest messageDigest){
    try(final Formatter formatter = new Formatter()){
      for (final byte b : messageDigest.digest()) {
        formatter.format("%02x", b);
      }
      
      return formatter.toString();
    }
  }

  @Override
  public void initialize() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException{
    messageDigestInstance = MessageDigest.getInstance(MESSAGE_DIGEST_NAME);
  }

}

BagitChecksumNameMapping.add("sha3256", SHA3Hasher.class);
```

#### How to create a new conformance profile 
This is beyond the scope of this project, however please see https://github.com/bagit-profiles/bagit-profiles for in-depth documentation on profiles. 

#### Classes/Methods not to use outside this project
There are many classes that were not designed to be used outside this project, the rules for this are:
* If a class/method does not contain a javadoc.
* If a class is in a package named "internal". Any internal classes can be removed at any time and effort will be made to preserve backwards compatibility.
* If a class is final, that class was not designed to be extended by users outside this project.

#### Javadocs
All public interfaces/classes have javadocs detailing what the class's responsibilities are and, what the methods do and are used for  (http://www.javadoc.io/doc).

#### Code coverage
To see a nice view of what code is covered by the various tests, check out [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/jscancella/bagging).
We strive to try and maintain 90% or better code coverage knowing that testing language specifics (like getters and setters) are not helpful. Ideally we also have 100% coverage of each branch condition, but again this is more an ideal than a hard requirement.

#### Testing (conformance-suite)
Because there are many test cases for using the BagIt specification correctly, the Library of Congress decided to create a suite of known issues as well as canonical basic bags for each specification version. These test cases are stored in a git repository and can be found at https://github.com/libraryofcongress/bagit-conformance-suite.git
We use these test cases to ensure we are correctly adhering to the BagIt specification.  

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
#### BagIt, bag, bagit, Bagger, Bagging names are all so similar. Why?!
Naming stuff is hard, and generally we humans are bad at naming similar things distinctly. So in order to make it easier, here is a short list of definitions
* bag - a group of files in a particular format to ensure the files received are correct and complete
* BagIt - the name of the specification (or how is a bag structured)
* bagit (notice the all lowercase naming) - The original java implementation that also contained a command line utility by the same name.
* Bagger - a java desktop application (GUI) that used bagit to create bags
* Bagging - this library which tries to correctly implement all versions of the BagIt specification in a clean and concise way

#### Is there a command line utility in here?
The short answer, no. The long answer is that having a java command line utility has caused more confusion and frustration than it has helped. If you need a command line implementation, try taking a look at the [python implementation from the Library of Congress](https://github.com/libraryofcongress/bagit-python) instead.

#### How do I include the tag-manifest checksum in the tag-manifest?
You don't because in order to generate a checksum of the tag file it can't change. Thus if you try to add a line for the tag-manifest containing a checksum, that checksum will change and no longer be valid.

#### How do I check/create a compressed (zip, gz, etc) bag using this library?
The specific functionality for checking or creating a bag while it is still compressed is not supported and there are not plans to support it in the future. I would recommend you use your favorite application to compress/decompress and then work with the bag as normal. 

#### Is BagIt good for archiving?
Maybe, it really depends on what you are trying to achieve. 
Are you trying to create a super safe copy of your files that will prevent bitrot and other storage problems from ever happening? - then no the BagIt specification won't help you because it can't keep files safe (erasure codes, multiple copies, etc) but only aids in checking completeness and correctness. If that is your use case, I would recommend that you use the BagIt specification when you receive files outside the internet and then use other software to ensure those files are safe from corruption.

## Technical Reference
One of the inspirations for writing this library was to create a simple to use interface for creating, reading, writing, verifying, and linting BagIt specification bags. The coding therefore tries to adhere with the best practices in [Effective Java by Joshua Bloch](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997) as well as experiences from the team members.

#### Windows Development Notes
* Install JDK 8+
* while gradle may work running from your IDE this has not been tested and isn't really supported. Instead run all gradle commands from the commandline using the `gradlew.bat` script root directory. git-bash seems to generally work, but sometimes crashes for unknown reasons.
* Before submitting a pull request run `./gradlew.bat clean check` and there are no errors.

#### Mac Development Notes
* Install JDK 8+
* while gradle may work running from your IDE this has not been tested and isn't really supported. Instead run all gradle commands from the commandline using the `gradlew` script root directory.
* Before submitting a pull request run `./gradlew.bat clean check` and there are no errors.

#### Linux Development Notes
* Install JDK 8+
* while gradle may work running from your IDE this has not been tested and isn't really supported. Instead run all gradle commands from the commandline using the `gradlew` script root directory.
* Before submitting a pull request run `./gradlew.bat clean check` and there are no errors.
